Project 1: 352> Shell

Use 'make' to compile the program, then ./shell352
This own shell contains some basic commands, such as ls and pwd.
The symbol '>', '<', and '|' are used for file redirection and pipes.
'&' at end of a line means the command will run in background, otherwise foreground.
'jobs' will list the background commands with status and job id.
control + z can stop the running foreground commands.
bg <job_id> changes the stopped command to the running command.

If there are something wrong with Makefile,
please try to edit Makefile by deleting the spaces in front of the commands and typing a TAB.
Sometime this happened to me when I git push the code to Gitlab.
